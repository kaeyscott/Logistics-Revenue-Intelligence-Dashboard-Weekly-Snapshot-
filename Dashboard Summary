# Logistics-Revenue-Intelligence-Dashboard-Weekly-Snapshot-
To analyze and present weekly logistics revenue performance across countries, states, and service centers, with specific focus on shipment types and revenue breakdowns for executive insights.

🔧 1. Data Integration:
Connected multiple tables (such as Shipment, Invoice, ServiceCentre, Station, etc.).
Applied data cleansing: filtering out non-consignable centers, non-public stations, deleted or invalid shipments.
Excluded specific waybills and locations (like CHINA, SPINTEX, etc.) not relevant for this analysis.

📊 2. Revenue Metrics Visualization:
Calculated:
Total Revenue across all locations.
Corporate Revenue (likely filtered based on a customer type or service category).
Total Export & Import Shipments counts.
Used card visuals for high-level KPIs to offer a quick glance at key metrics.

🌍 3. Country-Level Revenue Breakdown:
Built a matrix table summarizing GO Standard Revenue by country.
Added a secondary table for Total Revenue by Country.
Created a donut chart for Import Revenue by Location, with relative percentages (e.g., UK: 74.92%, Canada: 25.08%).

🏙️ 4. State-Level Revenue Analysis:
Displayed the Top 10 Nigerian States by Revenue in a table, ranked by total revenue.
E.g., Lagos leads with ₦28M+, followed by FCT and Rivers.

🏢 5. Service Center Performance:
I Created a bar chart visual of Centers by Revenue.Centers like Ikorodu, Ajah, Gwarimpa are top performers (each bringing in over ₦1.5M+).
Scrollable chart accommodates more than 10 locations.
📅 6. Time-Based Filtering:
Included a Weekday Name slicer to enable filtering revenue performance based on the day of the week (e.g., Monday to Sunday performance).
